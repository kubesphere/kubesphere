## What is KubeSphere

> English | [中文](README_zh.md)

[KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/) is a **distributed operating system for cloud-native application management**, using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as its kernel. It provides a plug-and-play architecture, allowing third-party applications to be seamlessly integrated into its ecosystem. KubeSphere is also a multi-tenant container platform with full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly wizard web UI, helping enterprises to build out a more robust and feature-rich platform, which includes most common functionalities needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategy, see [Feature List](#features) for details.

The following screenshots give a close insight into KubeSphere. Please check [What is KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/docs/introduction/what-is-kubesphere/) for further information.

## Architecture

KubeSphere uses a loosely-coupled architecture that separates the [frontend](https://github.com/kubesphere/console) from the [backend](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). External systems can access the components of the backend through the REST APIs.

## Latest release

🎉 KubeSphere 3.3.1 was released! It brings enhancements and better user experience, see the [Release Notes For 3.3.1](https://kubesphere.io/docs/release/release-v330/) for the updates.
## Installation

KubeSphere can run anywhere from on-premise datacenter to any cloud to edge. In addition, it can be deployed on any version-compatible Kubernetes cluster. The installer will start a minimal installation by default, you can [enable other pluggable components before or after installation](https://kubesphere.io/docs/quick-start/enable-pluggable-components/).
### Quick start
#### Installing on K8s/K3s

Ensure that your cluster has installed Kubernetes v1.19.x, v1.20.x, v1.21.x, * v1.22.x, * v1.23.x, or * v1.24.x. For Kubernetes versions with an asterisk, some features of edge nodes may be unavailable due to incompatibility. Therefore, if you want to use edge nodes, you are advised to install Kubernetes v1.21.x or earlier.
Run the following commands to install KubeSphere on an existing Kubernetes cluster:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.3.1/kubesphere-installer.yaml
   
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.3.1/cluster-configuration.yaml
```
#### All-in-one

👨‍💻 No Kubernetes? You can use [KubeKey](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey) to install both KubeSphere and Kubernetes/K3s in single-node mode on your Linux machine. Let's take K3s as an example:

```yaml
# Download KubeKey
curl -sfL https://get-kk.kubesphere.io | VERSION=v2.3.0 sh -
# Make kk executable
chmod +x kk
# Create a cluster
./kk create cluster --with-kubernetes v1.21.4-k3s --with-kubesphere v3.3.1
```

You can run the following command to view the installation logs. After KubeSphere is successfully installed, you can access the KubeSphere web console at `http://IP:30880` and log in using the default administrator account (admin/P@88w0rd).

```yaml
kubectl logs -n kubesphere-system $(kubectl get pod -n kubesphere-system -l 'app in (ks-install, ks-installer)' -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -f
``` 
### KubeSphere for hosted Kubernetes services

KubeSphere is hosted on the following cloud providers, and you can try KubeSphere by one-click installation on their hosted Kubernetes services. 

- [KubeSphere for Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/qingcloud-kubesphere/)
- [KubeSphere for Azure AKS](https://market.azure.cn/marketplace/apps/qingcloud.kubesphere)
- [KubeSphere for DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/kubesphere)
- [KubeSphere on QingCloud AppCenter(QKE)](https://www.qingcloud.com/products/kubesphereqke)

You can also install KubeSphere on other hosted Kubernetes services within minutes, see the [step-by-step guides](https://kubesphere.io/docs/installing-on-kubernetes/) to get started.

> 👨‍💻 No internet access? Refer to the [Air-gapped Installation on Kubernetes](https://kubesphere.io/docs/installing-on-kubernetes/on-prem-kubernetes/install-ks-on-linux-airgapped/) or [Air-gapped Installation on Linux](https://kubesphere.io/docs/installing-on-linux/introduction/air-gapped-installation/) for instructions on how to use private registry to install KubeSphere.
