## What is KubeSphere

> English | [中文](README_zh.md)

[KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/) is a **distributed operating system providing cloud native stack** with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as its kernel, and aims to be plug-and-play architecture for third-party applications seamless integration to boost its ecosystem. KubeSphere is also a multi-tenant enterprise-grade container platform with full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly wizard web UI, helping enterprises to build out a more robust and feature-rich platform, which includes most common functionalities needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategy, see [Feature List](#features) for details.

The following screenshots give a close insight into KubeSphere. Please check [What is KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/docs/introduction/what-is-kubesphere/) for further information.

## Demo Environment

Using the account `demo1 / Demo123` to log in the [demo environment](https://demo.kubesphere.io/). Please note the account is granted view access. You can also have a quick view of [KubeSphere Demo Video](https://youtu.be/u5lQvhi_Xlc).

## Architecture

KubeSphere uses a loosely-coupled architecture that separates the [frontend](https://github.com/kubesphere/console) from the [backend](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). External systems can access the components of the backend which are delivered as Docker containers through the REST APIs. See [Architecture](https://kubesphere.io/docs/introduction/architecture/) for details.
