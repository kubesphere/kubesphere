## What is KubeSphere

> English | [中文](README_zh.md)

[KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/) is a **distributed operating system providing cloud native stack** with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as its kernel, and aims to be plug-and-play architecture for third-party applications seamless integration to boost its ecosystem. KubeSphere is also a multi-tenant enterprise-grade container platform with full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly wizard web UI, helping enterprises to build out a more robust and feature-rich platform, which includes most common functionalities needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategy, see [Feature List](#features) for details.

The following screenshots give a close insight into KubeSphere. Please check [What is KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/docs/introduction/what-is-kubesphere/) for further information.

## Demo Environment

Using the account `demo1 / Demo123` to log in the [demo environment](https://demo.kubesphere.io/). Please note the account is granted view access. You can also have a quick view of [KubeSphere Demo Video](https://youtu.be/u5lQvhi_Xlc).

## Architecture

KubeSphere uses a loosely-coupled architecture that separates the [frontend](https://github.com/kubesphere/console) from the [backend](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). External systems can access the components of the backend which are delivered as Docker containers through the REST APIs. See [Architecture](https://kubesphere.io/docs/introduction/architecture/) for details.

## Latest Release

KubeSphere 2.1.1 was released on **February 23rd, 2020**. See the [Release Notes For 2.1.1](https://kubesphere.io/docs/release/release-v211/) for the updates.

## Installation

KubeSphere can run anywhere from on-premise datacenter to any cloud to edge. In addition, it can be deployed on any version-compatible running Kubernetes cluster.

### Deploy on Existing Kubernetes Cluster

#### Prerequisites

- `Kubernetes version`： `1.15.x, 1.16.x, 1.17.x`
- `2.10.0 ≤ Helm Version ＜ 3.0.0` excluding 2.16.0 because of [#6894](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6894). Please see [Install and Configure Helm in Kubernetes](https://devopscube.com/install-configure-helm-kubernetes/). Helm v3 will be supported in KubeSphere 3.0.0.
- An existing Storage Class in your Kubernetes cluster, use `kubectl get sc` to verify it
- The CSR signing feature is activated in kube-apiserver, see [RKE installation issue](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/1925#issuecomment-591698309).

Install KubeSphere using kubectl.

- If there are 1 Core and 2 GB RAM available in your cluster, use the command below to set up a default minimal installation only. You can enable other components after installation if more resource added in later on. See [Pluggable Components Installation](https://kubesphere.io/docs/installation/pluggable-components/) for detailed information.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/master/kubesphere-minimal.yaml
```

- If there are 8 Cores and 16 GB RAM available in your cluster, use the command below to install a complete KubeSphere, i.e. with all components enabled:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/master/kubesphere-complete-setup.yaml
```

Wait the installation logs using the following command till showing `"Successful"`, then you can log in the console using the default username and password.

```bash
kubectl logs -n kubesphere-system $(kubectl get pod -n kubesphere-system -l app=ks-install -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -f
```

### Deploy on Linux

KubeSphere Installer can help you to install KubeSphere and Kubernetes on your linux machines. It provides [All-in-One](https://kubesphere.io/docs/installation/all-in-one/) and [Multi-Node](https://kubesphere.io/docs/installation/multi-node/) installation options.

#### Minimum Requirements

- Operating Systems
  - CentOS 7.5 (64 bit)
  - Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 LTS (64 bit)
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.4 (64 bit)
  - Debian Stretch 9.5 (64 bit)
- Hardware
  - CPU：2 Cores,  Memory：4 GB, Disk Space：100 GB

> Note:  Please disable the firewall, or ensure your firewall meets the [port requirements](https://kubesphere.io/docs/installation/port-firewall/).

#### All-in-One (QuickStart)

```bash
curl -L https://kubesphere.io/download/stable/latest > installer.tar.gz \
&& tar -zxf installer.tar.gz && cd kubesphere-all-v2.1.1/scripts
$ ./install.sh
```

Choose `"1) All-in-one"` to start the default minimal installation.

You can enable other components after installation, see [Pluggable Components Installation](https://kubesphere.io/docs/installation/pluggable-components/).
