Welcome to KubeSphere! (New Developer Guide)
============================================

_This document assumes that you know what KubeSphere does. 

Introduction
------------

This
document will help you understand the organization of the KubeSphere project and
direct you to the best places to get started. By the end of this doc, you'll be
able to pick up issues, write code to fix them, and get your work reviewed and
merged.

If you have questions about the development process, feel free to jump into our
[Slack workspace](http://KubeSphere.slack.com/). If you join the
Slack workspace it is recommended to set your Slack display name to your GitHub
account handle.



Downloading, Building, and Testing KubeSphere
---------------------------------------------

This guide is non-technical, so it does not cover the technical details of
working KubeSphere. We have plenty of documentation available under
[docs.kubesphere.io](https://docs.kubesphere.io).

Pull-Request Process
--------------------

The pull-request process is documented in [pull-requests.md](pull-requests.md).
As described in that document, you must sign the CLA before
KubeSphere can accept your contribution.

Thanks for reading!
