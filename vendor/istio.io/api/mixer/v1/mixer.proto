// Mixer provides three core features:
//
// - *Precondition Checking*. Enables callers to verify a number of preconditions
// before responding to an incoming request from a service consumer.
// Preconditions can include whether the service consumer is properly
// authenticated, is on the serviceâ€™s whitelist, passes ACL checks, and more.
//
// - *Quota Management*. Enables services to allocate and free quota on a number
// of dimensions, Quotas are used as a relatively simple resource management tool
// to provide some fairness between service consumers when contending for limited
// resources. Rate limits are examples of quotas.
//
// - *Telemetry Reporting*. Enables services to report logging and monitoring.
// In the future, it will also enable tracing and billing streams intended for
// both the service operator as well as for service consumers.
