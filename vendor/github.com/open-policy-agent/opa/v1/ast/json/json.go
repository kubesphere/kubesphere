// This package provides options for JSON marshalling of AST nodes, and location
// data in particular. Since location data occupies a significant portion of the
// AST when included, it is excluded by default. The options provided here allow
// changing that behavior â€” either for all nodes or for specific types. Since
// JSONMarshaller implementations have access only to the node being marshaled,
// our options are to either attach these settings to *all* nodes in the AST, or
// to provide them via global state. The former is perhaps a little more elegant,
// and is what we went with initially. The cost of attaching these settings to
// every node however turned out to be non-negligible, and given that the number
// of users who have an interest in AST serialization are likely to be few, we
// have since switched to using global state, as provided here. Note that this
// is mostly to provide an equivalent feature to what we had before, should
// anyone depend on that. Users who need fine-grained control over AST
// serialization are recommended to use external libraries for that purpose,
// such as `github.com/json-iterator/go`.
