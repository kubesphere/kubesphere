// This file contains a collection of methods that can be used from go-restful to
// generate Swagger API documentation for its models. Please read this PR for more
// information on the implementation: https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/pull/215
//
// TODOs are ignored from the parser (e.g. TODO(andronat):... || TODO:...) if and only if
// they are on one line! For multiple line or blocks that you want to ignore use ---.
// Any context after a --- is ignored.
//
// Those methods can be generated by using hack/update-generated-swagger-docs.sh

In a normal cluster project administrators are not able to alter their quotas - that is restricted to cluster administrators.\n\nListing or watching projects will return only projects the user has the reader role on.\n\nAn OpenShift project is an alternative representation of a Kubernetes namespace.
