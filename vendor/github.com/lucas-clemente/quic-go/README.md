quic-go is an implementation of the [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) protocol in Go. It roughly implements the [IETF QUIC draft](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts), although we don't fully support any of the draft versions at the moment.

## Version compatibility

Since quic-go is under active development, there's no guarantee that two builds of different commits are interoperable. The QUIC version used in the *master* branch is just a placeholder, and should not be considered stable.

If you want to use quic-go as a library in other projects, please consider using a [tagged release](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/releases). These releases expose [experimental QUIC versions](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/QUIC-Versions), which are guaranteed to be stable.

## Guides

*We currently support Go 1.13+, with [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support enabled.*

Installing and updating dependencies:

    go get -u ./...

Running tests:

    go test ./...

### QUIC without HTTP/3

Take a look at [this echo example](example/echo/echo.go).

## Usage

### As a server

See the [example server](example/main.go). Starting a QUIC server is very similar to the standard lib http in go:

```go
http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir(wwwDir)))
http3.ListenAndServeQUIC("localhost:4242", "/path/to/cert/chain.pem", "/path/to/privkey.pem", nil)
```

### As a client

See the [example client](example/client/main.go). Use a `http3.RoundTripper` as a `Transport` in a `http.Client`.

```go
http.Client{
  Transport: &http3.RoundTripper{},
}
```
