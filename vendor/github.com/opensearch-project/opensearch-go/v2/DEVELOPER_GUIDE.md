# Developer Guide

So you want to contribute code to the OpenSearch Go Client?  Excellent!  We're glad you're here.  Here's what you need to do:

## Getting Started

### Git Clone OpenSearch Go Client Repository

Fork [opensearch-project/opensearch-go](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-go) and clone locally,
e.g. `git clone https://github.com/[your username]/opensearch-go.git`.

### Install Prerequisites

#### Go 1.11
OpenSearch Go Client builds using [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11 at a minimum.

#### Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) is required for building some OpenSearch artifacts and executing integration tests.

### Unit Testing
Go has a simple tool for running tests, and we simplified it further by creating this make command:
 ```
make test-unit
```
 
Individual unit tests can be run with the following command:
```
cd folder-path/to/test;
go test -v -run TestName; 
```

### Integration Testing
In order to test opensearch-go client, you need a running OpenSearch cluster. You can use Docker to accomplish this. 
The [Docker Compose file](.ci/opensearch/docker-compose.yml) supports the ability to run integration tests for the project in local environments.
If you have not installed docker-compose, you can install it from this [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

In order to differentiate unit tests from integration tests, Go has a built-in mechanism for allowing you to logically separate your tests
with [build tags](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Build_constraints). The build tag needs to be placed as close to the top of the file as possible, and must have a blank line beneath it.
Hence, create all integration tests with build tag 'integration'.

#### Execute integration tests from your terminal
1. Run below command to start containers. By default, it will launch latest OpenSearch cluster.
   ```
   make cluster.opensearch.build cluster.opensearch.start
   ```
2. Run all integration tests.
   ```
   make test-integ race=true
   ```
3. Stop and clean containers.
   ```
   make cluster.opensearch.stop cluster.clean
   ```
## Use an Editor

### GoLand
You can import the OpenSearch project into GoLand as follows:

1. Select **File | Open**
2. In the subsequent dialog navigate to the ~/go/src/opensearch-go and click **Open**

After you have opened your project, you need to specify the location of the Go SDK.
You can either specify a local path to the SDK or download it. To set the Go SDK, navigate to **Go | GOROOT** and 
set accordingly.
