Fernet takes a user-provided *message* (an arbitrary sequence of
bytes), a *key* (256 bits), and the current time, and produces a
*token*, which contains the message in a form that can't be read
or altered without the key.

This package is compatible with the other implementations at
https://github.com/fernet. They can exchange tokens freely among
each other.
