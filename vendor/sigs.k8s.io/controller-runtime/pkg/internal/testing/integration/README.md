# Integration Testing Framework

This package has been moved from [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/testing_frameworks/tree/master/integration](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/testing_frameworks/tree/master/integration).

A framework for integration testing components of kubernetes. This framework is
intended to work properly both in CI, and on a local dev machine. It therefore
explicitly supports both Linux and Darwin.

For detailed documentation see the
