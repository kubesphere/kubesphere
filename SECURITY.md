# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We follow an **End-of-Life (EOL)** policy to provide security and bug fix support for KubeSphere versions.

We regularly release patch versions to address security vulnerabilities and critical bugs for supported KubeSphere
releases. The support period for each version is determined by its **EOL date**, rather than by a fixed number of minor
versions.

The current support plan is as follows:

| KubeSphere Version            | End of Life (EOL) Date |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **KubeSphere v4.2**           | ---                    |
| **KubeSphere v4.1**           | Sep 12, 2027           |
| **KubeSphere v3.4**           | Dec 25, 2025           |
| **KubeSphere v3.3 & earlier** | Oct 31, 2025           |

Once a version reaches its EOL date, it will no longer receive official security updates or bug fixes. Older versions
may receive **critical security fixes on a best-effort basis**, but we cannot guarantee that all security patches will
be backported to unsupported versions.

In rare cases, where a security fix requires significant architectural changes or is otherwise highly intrusive, and a
feasible workaround exists, we may choose to **apply the fix only in a future release**, rather than backporting it to a
patch version for currently supported releases.

For long-term stability, we recommend users plan their upgrades according to the EOL schedule.

Let me know if you'd like any refinements!
