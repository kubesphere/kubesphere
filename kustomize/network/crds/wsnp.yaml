                                A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent
                                to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field
                                is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array
                                contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

                      rule matches all ports (traffic not restricted by port). If
                      this field is present and contains at least one item, then this
                      rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one
                      port in the list.

                field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of
                Ingress or Egress rules; policies that contain an Egress section are
                assumed to affect Egress, and all policies (whether or not they contain
                an Ingress section) are assumed to affect Ingress. If you want to
                write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes
                [ "Egress" ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies
                that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that
                include "Egress" (since such a policy would not include an Egress
                section and would otherwise default to just [ "Ingress" ]).
