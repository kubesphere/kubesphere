              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                    If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                    should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                    For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                    the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                    index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                    referencing a part of an object.
