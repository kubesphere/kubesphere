              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

              A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and
              matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null
              label selector matches no objects.

                    A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                    relates the key and values.

                    key:

                        operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
                        Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

                    values:
                      description: |-
                        values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
                        the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                        the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                        merge patch.

                  matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
                  map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                  operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
