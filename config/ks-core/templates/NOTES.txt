Thank you for choosing KubeSphere Helm Chart.

Please be patient and wait for several seconds for the KubeSphere deployment to complete.

1. Wait for Deployment Completion

    Confirm that all KubeSphere components are running by executing the following command:

    kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

{{- if or (eq .Values.multicluster.role "") (eq .Values.multicluster.role "host") }}
2. Access the KubeSphere Console

    Once the deployment is complete, you can access the KubeSphere console using the following URL:  {{"\n"}}
    {{- if not .Values.internalTLS }}
    http://{{ include "getNodeAddress" . }}:{{ .Values.console.nodePort }}
    {{- else }}
    https://{{ include "getNodeAddress" . }}:{{ .Values.console.nodePort }}
    {{- end }}

3. Login to KubeSphere Console

    Use the following credentials to log in:

    Account: admin
    Password: {{ include "printOrDefaultPass" . }}

NOTE: It is highly recommended to change the default password immediately after the first login.
