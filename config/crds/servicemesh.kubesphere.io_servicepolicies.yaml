This feature provides a mechanism for service owners and mesh administrators to control the visibility of destination rules across namespace boundaries. \n If no namespaces are specified then the destination rule is exported to all namespaces by default. \n The value \".\" is reserved and defines an export to the same namespace that the destination rule is declared in. Similarly, the value \"*\" is reserved and defines an export to all namespaces. \n NOTE: in the current release, the `exportTo` value is restricted to \".\" or \"*\" (i.e., the current namespace or all namespaces)."

A rule in the \"default\" namespace containing a host \"reviews\" will be interpreted as \"reviews.default.svc.cluster.local\", irrespective of the actual namespace associated with the reviews service. _To avoid potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully qualified domain names over short names._ \n Note that the host field applies to both HTTP and TCP services."

In addition, traffic policies defined at the service-level can be overridden at a subset-level. The following rule uses a round robin load balancing policy for all traffic going to a subset named testversion that is composed of endpoints (e.g., pods) with labels (version:v3). \n {{<tabset category-name=\"example\">}} {{<tab name=\"v1alpha3\" category-value=\"v1alpha3\">}} ```yaml apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: DestinationRule metadata:   name: bookinfo-ratings spec:   host: ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local   trafficPolicy:     loadBalancer:       simple: LEAST_CONN   subsets:   - name: testversion     labels:       version: v3     trafficPolicy:       loadBalancer:         simple: ROUND_ROBIN ``` {{</tab>}} \n {{<tab name=\"v1beta1\" category-value=\"v1beta1\">}} ```yaml apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1 kind: DestinationRule metadata:   name: bookinfo-ratings spec:   host: ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local   trafficPolicy:     loadBalancer:       simple: LEAST_CONN   subsets:   - name: testversion     labels:       version: v3     trafficPolicy:       loadBalancer:         simple: ROUND_ROBIN ``` {{</tab>}} {{</tabset>}} \n **Note:** Policies specified for subsets will not take effect until a route rule explicitly sends traffic to this subset. \n One or more labels are typically required to identify the subset destination, however, when the corresponding DestinationRule represents a host that supports multiple SNI hosts (e.g., an egress gateway), a subset without labels may be meaningful. In this case a traffic policy with [ClientTLSSettings](#ClientTLSSettings) can be used to identify a specific SNI host corresponding to the named subset."
