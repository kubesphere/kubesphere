                returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports
                it. If not specified, it indicates that the creation time of the snapshot
                is unknown.

                waiting for the snapshot to be created based on the type of error

              description: readyToUse indicates if a snapshot is ready to be used
                to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field
                will be filled in with the "ready_to_use" value returned from CSI
                "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this
                field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value returned from the
                CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it, otherwise,
                this field will be set to "True". If not specified, it means the readiness

                If not specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.
