Similarly the value \"*\" is reserved and defines an export to all namespaces. \n NOTE: in the current release, the `exportTo` value is restricted to \".\" or \"*\" (i.e., the current namespace or all namespaces)."

Gateways in other namespaces may be referred to by `<gateway namespace>/<gateway name>`; specifying a gateway with no namespace qualifier is the same as specifying the VirtualService's namespace. A single VirtualService is used for sidecars inside the mesh as well as for one or more gateways. The selection condition imposed by this field can be overridden using the source field in the match conditions of protocol-specific routes. The reserved word `mesh` is used to imply all the sidecars in the mesh. When this field is omitted, the default gateway (`mesh`) will be used, which would apply the rule to all sidecars in the mesh. If a list of gateway names is provided, the rules will apply only to the gateways. To apply the rules to both gateways and sidecars, specify `mesh` as one of the gateway names.

Depending on the platform, short-names can also be used instead of a FQDN (i.e. has no dots in the name). In such a scenario, the FQDN of the host would be derived based on the underlying platform. \n A single VirtualService can be used to describe all the traffic properties of the corresponding hosts, including those for multiple HTTP and TCP ports. Alternatively, the traffic properties of a host can be defined using more than one VirtualService, with certain caveats. Refer to the [Operations Guide](https://istio.io/docs/ops/best-practices/traffic-management/#split-virtual-services) for details. \n *Note for Kubernetes users*: When short names are used (e.g. \"reviews\" instead of \"reviews.default.svc.cluster.local\"), Istio will interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not the service. A rule in the \"default\" namespace containing a host \"reviews\" will be interpreted as \"reviews.default.svc.cluster.local\", irrespective of the actual namespace associated with the reviews service. _To avoid potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully qualified domain names over short names._ \n The hosts field applies to both HTTP and TCP services. Service inside the mesh, i.e., those found in the service registry, must always be referred to using their alphanumeric names. IP addresses are allowed only for services defined via the Gateway. \n *Note*: It must be empty for a delegate VirtualService."
